# card_games

make sure the directory is set right for the files:
directory = os.path.expanduser("~/Documents/Card_game")
os.chdir(directory)

run python code: server_player.py

check your IPv4 addres in settings (ex: 192.168.0.1)
every player should be connected to the same network

1 player goes to "IPv4":8000/host_player.html (ex: 192.168.0.1:8000/host_player.html)
rest of the players to "IPv4":8000/player.html (ex: 192.168.0.1:8000/player.html)

host should manage games

have fun
